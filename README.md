# PROJECT TITLE: FACE DETECTION USING CNN aka ConvNets

## DESCRIPTION:
<br>This repository gives budding Deep Learning enthusiats a gentle introduction to the topic of Deep Learning.</br>
<br>In this repository , I will list down all the steps needed to get started with your first project in Deep Learning.</br>
<br>So go ahead, Fork this repo and get started with Deep Learning.</br>

## CONTENTS:
1. Dataset download
2. Tools & Libraries
3. Code
4. Instructions to run the code
5. Future improvements

## EXPLANATIONS:
1. Dataset download:
<br>For this project we will be using the UMD face dataset which can be downloaded from [UMD Face Dataser] (https://github.com/kalyanghosh/Face-Detection-using-CNN/blob/master/umd1.jpg)</br>
<br>Go ahead and download the Batch 3 dataset, which will have faces of personalities and and .csv file that contains the annotations
to crop out the face from each of the images(https://github.com/kalyanghosh/Face-Detection-using-CNN/blob/master/umd2.jpg)</br>
